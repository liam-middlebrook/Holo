I've seen a lot of tutorials online about how to make a phone sized reflective prism for projecting 'holograms' (not technically a hologram, but creates the illusion of one). However, they were too small to be very interesting, and I couldn't find any software to render a object properly. As a result, I created a 4-sided reflective prism from 8"x10" lexan sheets, and wrote software to render an object in the proper perspectives.

## Features
 * Uses multiple glViewports to render the object onto the same screen from different perspectives.
 * Normalizes the size of an object to properly fit on the screen.
 * Adjustable distance and rotation.
